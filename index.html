			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Question: How has the population age structure changed from 1900 to 2000, moving towards aging or rejuvenation?</strong>
		</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="scatter chart.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The scatter plot compares the population in thousands across different age groups, 
					segmented by gender for the years 1900 and 2000, illustrating demographic shifts over a century.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>First step, as an overview, scatter charter can simply and directly plot the dataset. And the use of a scatter plot allows for the easy observation of trends and patterns.</li>
				<li>Since I want to compare data in different years, I used the same color for two genders in the same year with different symbols (circle and triangle). 
					In my view, for visual effects, color impact and contrast may take priority over symbols.</li>
				<li>The limited color ratio of the scatter chart leads to insufficient visual impact. 
					For the next sketch, I tried a barchart.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="population pyramid.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The Age-Sex Population Pyramids for 1900 and 2000, display the distribution of male (left) and female (right) populations across different age groups, 
					with color-coded bars representing each gender for comparative analysis over the century.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>More color coverage makes it clearer how many people are at each age. The form of the population pyramid makes the population structure clear at a glance.</li>
				<li>Instead of using different colors for male and female populations, which could potentially create confusion when comparing the two years, distinct symbols (circle for males and triangle for females) were chosen. </li>
				<li>By aligning both pyramids along a central axis, viewers can easily contrast the age distribution of the population at these two points in time.</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If the audience is the general public, to help them understand the approximate data facts more quickly, 
					it's acceptable to sacrifice a little accuracy and to further figurate and visualize the data.</li>
				<li>An interesting symbol can attract more audiences to read the figure.</li>
				<li>Using a denser cluster of symbols to represent larger population sizes can provide a quick visual cue of demographic concentration. 
					This method works well to show relative sizes of age groups at a glance.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>1. Scatter Plot</strong>
		<p>It provides a detailed view of population data, where each point represents a specific data value. 
			However, it may be less immediately graspable for a general audience without a background in data interpretation.
		</p>
		<strong>2. Population Pyramids</strong>
		<p>As a classic demographic tool it effectively communicates the balance—or imbalance—between different age groups and genders. 
			It excels in comparative analysis between two time periods, offering a straightforward visual of population structure. 
		</p>
		<strong>3. Figurative Diagram</strong>
		<p>I humanized the data, potentially increasing engagement and emotional connection. 
			It is more accessible to a lay audience and can be particularly effective in educational contexts. 
			However, this approach may struggle with clarity when representing densely populated age groups and is less precise than the scatter plot or the bar chart.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, my research question aims to explore if it was aging or rejuvenation from 1900 to 2000. 
			Therefore, calculating the percentages of each age group offers a more direct way than presenting the audience with the exact numbers of individuals. 
			Given that calculations can be time-consuming and I was only allowed to create sketches, I should, in preparation, compute the precise percentages for each age group before using charting tools. 
			Moreover, having observed minimal differences in the data related to gender, my next step will be to consolidate this information to eliminate any superfluous details.

		<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

		<p>
			<p>
				The final visualization transitions from initial sketches to a digital bar chart, capturing the population percentage distribution by age in 1900 and 2000. 
				This design choice was informed by the need to compare age structures over time, directly addressing the research question of aging or rejuvenation in the population. 
				The bar chart format was chosen for its clear, intuitive display of percentages, allowing for an immediate visual comparison across age groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				Visual encodings were carefully selected: uniform color shades differentiate between age groups while maintaining visual coherence, and bar lengths represent population percentages, enabling quick assessments of demographic shifts. 
				This approach emphasizes the relative size of each age cohort, pertinent to understanding population aging patterns. 
				While this design effectively communicates the distribution of age groups, it omits gender differentiation, as it was found to be less significant for the central research question.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final design, therefore, tells a focused story of how the population's age structure has shifted. Audiences can draw the conclusion at a glance that the population structure is rejuvenation from 1900 to 2000.
				It simplifies complex data into an accessible format.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The sketching phase was a pivotal step in the development of the final design, serving as a creative sandbox for exploring various methods of visual representation. 
		The process of sketching allowed for rapid iteration and immediate visual feedback, which was crucial in understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach. 
		It became clear that while the hand-drawn illustrations added a human element, they lacked the precision needed to convey the aging trends effectively. 
		The population pyramid, on the other hand, offered clarity in comparative analysis but did not emphasize the proportionate changes over time as clearly as needed. 
		These insights led to the discarding of gender-specific data, which was less central to the research question, and the adoption of a percentage-based bar chart that provided a clear, quantitative comparison of age distributions. 
		The final design, therefore, is a optimized result of these explorations, leveraging the directness of bar lengths for percentages and the intuitiveness of a color-coded age structure to tell the story of population aging.
